            description: "This project involved extensive data exploration and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the dataset suitable for model training. I compared several models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Additionally, I explored ensemble techniques to enhance model performance. Despite these efforts, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of only 68%, highlighting the challenge of accurately predicting water potability with the available dataset and the need for further improvements or additional data.",

            description: "This project, derived from a speech recognition course, focuses on classifying music genres by extracting key audio features such as MFCCs, Chroma, and Root Mean Square. Various machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Cross Gradient Boosting to classify the genres. The process involves data preprocessing using label encoding and optimizing models with different hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy. Through this approach, the project highlights the application of machine learning in audio signal processing and genre classification.",
